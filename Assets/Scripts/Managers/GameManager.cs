    //event driven programming: paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such has user input rather than a linear sequence of instructions.  Allows for more flexibility and responsiveness in a program as it can react to event as they happen rather than waiting for a specific point in code to execute.  Events are the backbone of the observer pattern.
